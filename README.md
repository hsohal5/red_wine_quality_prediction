# Red wine quality prediction

## Problem Description:
Forecasted the quality of red wine depending upon the physicochemical
properties using neural network. Most of the wines become better with age and their value and cost
increased depending on the features that changes over time. In wine producing countries like Italy,
France etc, most of the economy depends on wine production, wine certification and assessment is
required to determine the quality of wine and to avoid adulteration. So, this model can be used by
certification bodies to determine the quality and value of the wine.
